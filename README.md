Breakup Buddy

Sometimes it's hard not to call someone that was someone you called your best friend after a break-up, so this app will include:
a) a countdown since the last time you called (be proud!)
b) user can register to personalize his/her address book with a list of good friends to call versus their ex and have chat capabilities?
c) are you feeling the urge? use either a magic 8 ball type randomly generated set of activities the user can do if they feel the urge to call/or a locations tab to find local activites around the area (not sure which one i'll go with, mvp!)
