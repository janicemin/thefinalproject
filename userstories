User can register and sign in/logout

User can either "shake" a magic 8 ball to get a randomly generated set of activities he/she could do rather than call their ex OR put in their location and see what activities there are in the area (would this be AJAX/API call from, say, like USA Today for events in the area?)

User can chat with their list of trusted buddies. 

User can add, delete or modify their list of buddies. 

User can indicate on the very first page/log-in page if they are sober or not, which will immediately take them to the main page if yes or to a page that will simply say "DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT DUDE!" which after clicking, you can go to the main page. 

User can easily see from the countdown clock how many days since they registered and remained "call free"
